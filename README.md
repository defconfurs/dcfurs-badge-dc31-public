## Builds Folder

### OSD.ino.uf2

This is an LED test for the badge.

### OSDColour.ino.uf2

We had issues with the OSD.ino program not detecting shorted LEDs, so this is a test program that works better at that.

### OSDColour500.ino.uf2

Same as above, just faster.

### DCFurs31_initial.ino.uf2

This is the initial release firmware on the badges.
